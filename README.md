Interactive JS DOM & Events Project
Description

This project demonstrates how to make a webpage interactive using JavaScript.
It covers DOM selection, event listeners, and dynamic style modifications without altering the HTML file.

Features Implemented

Footer Click Counter

Clicking the footer logs a message in the console.

The message includes a counter showing the number of clicks.

Hamburger Menu Toggle

Clicking the hamburger button shows or hides the navigation menu by toggling the collapse class.

First Card Edit Button

Clicking the "Edit" button on the first card changes its text color to red permanently until the page is reloaded.

Second Card Edit Button Toggle

Clicking the "Edit" button on the second card toggles the text color between green and the default color.

Navbar Double-Click "Nuclear Mode"

Double-clicking the navbar disables the Bootstrap CSS, giving the page a plain appearance.

Double-clicking again restores the Bootstrap styles.

Card Shrink on "View" Hover

Hovering over the "View" button of any card collapses the text and reduces the image size to 20%.

Hovering again restores the card to its original state.

Usage

Open exo_events.html in a browser.

Open the browser console (F12 â†’ Console) to see the click messages.

Interact with the footer, navbar, and cards to see all features in action.
